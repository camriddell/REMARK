# Frequenty Asked Questions

Does inclusion of a REMARK in the catalog indicate that the Econ-ARK project endorses any concusions in it?

- No. This is a place for the material to be posted publicly for other people to see and form judgments on. Nevertheless, pull requests for attempted replications that are unsuccessful for unknown reasons will require a bit more attention from the Econ-ARK staff, which may include contacting the original author(s) to see if they can explain the discrepancies, or may include consulting with experts in the particular area in question.
